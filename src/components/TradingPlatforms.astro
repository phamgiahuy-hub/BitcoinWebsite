      <h3>Security Tips When Using Trading Platforms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong> - This adds an extra layer of security beyond just your password.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Unique, Strong Password</strong> - Never reuse passwords from other sites.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider a Hardware Wallet</strong> - For larger amounts, move your bitcoin off exchanges to a hardware wallet.</li>
        <li><strong>Verify Website URLs</strong> - Always check you're on the legitimate exchange website to avoid phishing attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Start Small</strong> - Begin with small purchases until you're comfortable with the platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Research Local Regulations</strong> - Ensure the platform complies with regulations in your jurisdiction.</li>
