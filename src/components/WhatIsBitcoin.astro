        <p>
          Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (fiat money), Bitcoin operates on a peer-to-peer network without the need for intermediaries like banks.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, Bitcoin is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to control its creation and management, rather than relying on central authorities. The cryptocurrency's maximum supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it a scarce digital resource similar to gold.

        <h3>Why Bitcoin Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Bitcoin represents a fundamental shift in how we think about money and value transfer in the digital age. For the first time in history, we have a form of money that is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not controlled by any government or corporation</li>
          <li>Resistant to inflation and monetary debasement</li>
          <li>Accessible to anyone with internet access</li>
          <li>Able to transfer value globally without permission</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As traditional financial systems face increasing challenges, Bitcoin offers an alternative that many see as a hedge against economic uncertainty and a solution to financial exclusion worldwide.
